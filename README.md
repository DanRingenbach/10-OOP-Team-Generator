# 10-OOP-Team-Generator

## Description
For this project I created an command-line program which prompts the user via *Inquirer* with questions regarding the makeup of their team.  Then with the user data the program generates a unique and stylish HTML webpage that displays the user's team information.  There are four tests run with *Jest* that guaruntee the accuracy of the information collected.

Through the building of this application I learned how to use *Inquirer*, *Jest*, and how to use *Node.js* to generate an HTML file.
